\section{Discussion}

We introduce an innovative framework, referred to as Laplace-Beltrami Surface Representation (LBSR), for generating molecular representations from surface manifolds. This novel approach combines geometric and chemical attributes represented as functions on the molecular surface manifold, utilizing harmonic message passing in the spectral domain. By integrating these attributes, we can capture molecular representations at different resolutions. Our LBSR method demonstrates promising results in protein pocket classification.

\paragraph{Limitation}

Our approach primarily emphasizes surfaces over volumes, assuming biomolecules possess rigid surfaces. However, achieving a more detailed modeling of biomolecules is possible. Adopting a quantum chemistry perspective could enhance system precision. Additionally, compared to graph neural networks based on atomic 3D coordinates, our surface-oriented approach lacks modeling of chemical bond information. Finally, extensive preprocessing significantly limits our method's speed. Consequently, we intend to advance our research in these directions.

Protein is the main carrier of life activities, and predicting protein binding sites can better help us predict protein function. In this project, we introduce the Laplace-Beltrami Surface Representation (LBSR) learning framework for protein binding site prediction. This pioneering approach leverages the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions associated with a molecule's surface to formulate its representation, placing it within a 2D Riemannian manifold. LBSR furnishes a multi-resolution representation that adeptly captures both the geometric and chemical features of molecules. Furthermore, we introduce a harmonic message-passing mechanism, facilitating efficient spectral message propagation across the surface manifold. Our proposed method proves competitive with contemporary state-of-the-art deep learning models in ligand-binding protein pocket classification, underscoring its versatility and effectiveness in the domain of molecular representation learning.
